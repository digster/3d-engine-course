# STATE — resume key

This file mirrors the `STATE` block from the master prompt (CLAUDE.md §9). It is the
single source of truth for "where the course is". Update it at the end of every lesson.
To resume: read CLAUDE.md (the binding spec), then this file, then continue from `next`.

```STATE
course: Build a Professional 3D Game Engine (SDL3 + C++20)
version: 1.0
updated: 2026-07-17 (after Lesson 0.6)

conventions:
  world: right-handed, Y-up, -Z forward
  clip: left-handed, +Y up, z in [0,1] (SDL_GPU-fixed; projection absorbs the flip)
  sw-rasterizer: targets SDL_GPU's exact NDC (Module 4 port = API change, not maths change)
  matrices: column vectors, v' = M*v, column-major storage
  winding: CCW = front, cull back (per-pipeline state; set explicitly every time)
  units: 1 unit = 1 metre; radians internally; linear colour in the renderer
  axis colours: x/y/z = red/green/blue (every diagram, no exceptions)
  sdl3: FetchContent, pinned GIT_TAG release-3.4.12 (main is 3.5.0 but unreleased);
        target SDL3::SDL3; SDL_TEST_LIBRARY OFF
  sdl3-api: bool SDL_Init / bool SDL_PollEvent; SDL_CreateWindow(title,w,h,flags) — no x/y;
            SDL_CreateRenderer(window,name); event.key.key (NOT SDL2's keysym.sym);
            #include <SDL3/SDL_main.h> separately for the entry point; classic main + own loop
  shaders: HLSL -> SDL_shadercross (3.0.0-preview) -> SPIR-V/DXIL/MSL  [Module 4+]
  cpp: C++20, no exceptions/RTTI in core, snake_case, -Wall -Wextra // /W4, all warnings fixed
  build: CMake >= 3.24, out-of-source (build/), 64-bit; two phases (configure, build);
         Debug build = -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug (adds -g)

completed:
  - 0.1  What a Game Engine Actually Is
  - 0.2  How This Course Works
  - 0.3  Setting Up Your Toolchain
  - 0.4  CMake From Zero
  - 0.5  Your First Window
  - 0.6  Reading Headers & the Debugger
  ===> MODULE 0 COMPLETE <===

capabilities:
  - verified C++20 toolchain (MSVC / GCC / Clang), 64-bit
  - portable CMake build; FetchContent fetches + builds + links SDL3 (release-3.4.12)
  - engine app: opens a 1280x720 window, event loop (quit + Esc), clean shutdown,
    startup log line reporting the linked SDL version
  - init -> create -> loop -> destroy skeleton in src/main.cpp
  - skills: reading SDL headers as source of truth; debugging with lldb/gdb/VS
